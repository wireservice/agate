journalism is a Python library that takes the horror out of basic data analysis and manipulation. It is an alternative to numpy and pandas that optimizes for human performance, rather than CPU performance.

It is inspired by underscore.js and all the other libraries that know how to get the hell out of the way and let me do journalism.

For many more ideas on how to apply agate, check out the [`Cookbook`](https://agate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook.html), which includes dozens of examples of specific features of agate as well as recipes for substituting agate for Excel, SQL, R and more. Also check out the agate's [`Extensions`](https://agate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions.html) which add support for reading/writing SQL tables, performing statistical analysis and more.\n",
